                    <p>COOKIES AND POLICIES<br>GG Player may use two types of cookies to track user activity:
                        Session ID cookies and persistent cookies. Session ID cookies are a set of data stored on a
                        user's device that is related to a particular session. Session ID cookies also help reduce the
                        system load time, server processing, and quick data rendering.</p>
                    <p>When the user logs out, the cookie is removed. Persistent cookies are stored as a small text file
                        on the user's computer for extended periods, which may contain passwords and other preferred
                        information. This data is not used for personally identifiable information.</p>

                        stamp, the number of clicks, platform type, broad demographic data, and comprehensive usage
                        statistics. Nevertheless, none of the information stored in our log files is associated with
                        personally identifiable information.</p>
